# People Analytics: Modeling(Classification)

#### Client: Top 3 self-storage company

#### Project goal: 

Build a classification model to improve top talent retention and workforce planning efforts.

#### Data available:
~18K rows & 40 columns
- This dataset started with ~300K rows, ~250 columns and 70% missing data. After data cleaning and manipulation, now we are working with ~18K rows & 40 columns and no missing data.
- Row Entity: The entity in each row is a unique employee and that’s represented in column ‘EEID’. 

NOTE:
This is not imagined to be a 'black box' type of solution. 
e.g. This model can help with the following:

1. Workforce planning: What percantage of a certain cohort is 'at risk of leaving' a company?
2. Top Talent Retention: Let's say that someone who you consider to be a top talent is 'labeled' as someone who is 'at risk of leaving' a company. That info might help HR Department to be proactive and potentially offer some incentives to try to retain top talent.
3. What-If analysis: This analysis showed that reducing Employee Turnover by 1% is associated with saving 1 - 2 million dollars in Cost of Employee Turnover.
