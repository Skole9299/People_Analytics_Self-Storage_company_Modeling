# People Analytics: Modeling(Classification)

#### Client: Top 3 self-storage company

#### Project goal: 

Build a classification model to improve top talent retention and workforce planning efforts.

#### Data available:
~18K rows & 40 columns

NOTE:
This is not imagined to be a 'black box' type of solution. This model can help in with for example the following:

1. Workforce planning: What percantage of a certain cohort is 'at risk of leaving' a company soon?
2. Top Talent Retention: Let's say that someone who you consider to be a top talent is 'labeled' as someone who is 'at risk of leaving' a company. That info might help HR Department to be proactive and offer salary increase & other incentives to try to retain top talent.
3. What-If analysis: This analysis showed that reducing Employee Turnover 1% is associated with saving 1 - 2 million dollars in Cost of Employee Turnover.
